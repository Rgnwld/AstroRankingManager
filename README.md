## ðŸš§ This ranking is still in early development

This is only for study and early tests in Astro development. Please dont use it in production.<br />
The propose of this project is to provide and handle requisitions of the [Astro Game](https://rgnwld.itch.io/astro).<br />
Such as:

- Rank the players by their times in each map.
- Provide informations about the game news.

## ðŸš§ Start up this manager:

To start this manager, run the `make up` command. This command will compile an API and start a database container with all the dependencies necessary for the successful execution of the manager.<br />
For development proposals, use the `make dev` command. It will build and run the containers with the logs attached to the terminal.<br />
For development proposals using only the database, run the `make db` command. It will build the database container and export its port.<br />
For more commands run `make help`.
